Customer Booking Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach
This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of a customer completing a flight booking.  The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various factors influencing booking completion and provides insights into potential areas for improvement in the booking process.

I. Project Overview
The goal is to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can identify which bookings are most likely to be completed and which are at higher risk of cancellation or abandonment. This information can be valuable for proactive customer engagement strategies and resource allocation.

II. Data and Methodology
The project utilizes a dataset containing various customer booking details, including:

Number of Passengers
Sales Channel
Trip Type
Purchase Lead Time
Length of Stay
Flight Hour
Flight Day
Route (removed due to high cardinality)
Booking Origin (converted to booking continent)
Additional Services (Extra baggage, Preferred seat, In-flight meals)
Flight Duration
Booking Complete (target variable)
Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Data: (If applicable, detail the method used)
Outlier Treatment: Outliers in numerical features (purchase_lead, length_of_stay) were identified and handled using Z-score based outlier removal.
Feature Scaling: Numerical features were normalized to a 0-1 range.
Categorical Feature Encoding: Categorical features (sales_channel, trip_type, flight_day, booking_continent) were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding as appropriate.
Class Imbalance Handling: The target variable (booking_complete) exhibited class imbalance. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was used to oversample the minority class and balance the dataset.
Model Selection and Training:

The XGBoost algorithm was selected for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its robust performance in classification tasks.  Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance, focusing on maximizing recall.

III. Results and Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% in predicting booking completion.  Performance was evaluated using various metrics, including:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
A detailed confusion matrix is included to illustrate the model's performance across different classes.  Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential factors contributing to booking completion.

IV. Further Development
Potential future improvements include:

Incorporating additional features to enhance model accuracy.
Exploring alternative machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Developing a user-friendly interface for presenting model predictions and insights.
Implementing the model into a real-time system for proactive customer engagement.
